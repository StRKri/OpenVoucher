Upgrading a running installation
================================

If you're upgrading from a previous version, please follow these instructions:

!!! When upgrading, you MUST have at least version 0.4.3 installed. If not, you should do a full reinstallation of OpenVoucher. You can export your MySQL database before the reinstallation and import it to the new database schema, to keep your data

----

* Copy the archive to your server and extract it

* Change to the www directory of your webserver. On Debian systems, this is usually /var/www or /var/www/html

* Copy the file includes/config.php to a safe place, e.g. /root/

* While still in the www directory, delete all contents of this directory (rm -rf *)

* Copy the contents of the src/ directory from the archive into your www directory (please don't forget the .htaccess file, it is a hidden file!)

* Copy the file config.php, which you have just saved, back to it's original location to restore your config settings

* Make sure all the files and directorys inside your www directory are owned by the user running the webserver (e.g. chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/)

* Change to the database/ directory from the archive

* Perform a database upgrade using the following command: mysql -u root -p < upgrade_0.4.3-1.0.0.sql (you will be asked for your mysql root password)

You're done!
