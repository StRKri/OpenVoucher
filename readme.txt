OpenVoucher is an open source voucher-system for authenticating guests in your wifi or cable network. It is designed to be easy to use for anyone who wants to issue vouchers.

See wiki on github for further information.

I'm still working on this but the project makes progress. Of course, any support is welcome ;)
